PigFramework
============

a PHP framework for developers who are as lazy as pigs

## Feature

* the whole framework is just ONE php file and three EMPTY folders (model/controller/view)
* the source codes and file strucute are easy, so it's good for learning purposes
* provide one web interface for you to create your websites IN BROWSER

## Does this describe you?

* you are as lazy as a pig

* you don't want to configure anything

* you wish the file structure is simple enough for even pig can understand

* but you still wish it implements MVC pattern

* you are very lazy and you hope you can develop web applications in a web interface, so you can build websites by clicking some buttons in the browder

## Principle ##
* convention over configuration.

* make everything so easy that even beginner can understand and learn from source code
* if making one thing configurable make things too complicated, then don't make if configurable
